        <h1>Tristan Knott</h1>
        <p>6-year veteran in the Air National Guard looking to broaden my horizons as a software developer and 
            bring creativity back into my life. I enjoy outdoor activities such as biking, rock climbing, and 
            chilling on the beach with various interests spanning from global geopolitics to woodworking. My aim 
            in life is to obtain a remote job in programming and explore the country in my van! My favorite color 
            is orange and favorite foods gotta be anything drenched in gorgonzola cheese sause.</p>
